# warp-docker

Run official [Cloudflare WARP](https://1.1.1.1/) client in Docker.

## Usage

### Start the container

To run the WARP client in Docker, just write the following content to `docker-compose.yml` and run `docker-compose up -d`.

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  warp:
    image: edwinhuish/warp
    container_name: warp
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - '1080:1080'
    environment:
      # - WARP_LICENSE_KEY= # optional
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
    sysctls:
      - net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=0
      - net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark=1
    volumes:
      - ./data:/var/lib/cloudflare-warp
```

Try it out to see if it works:

```bash
curl --socks5 127.0.0.1:1080 https://cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/trace
```

If the output contains `warp=on` or `warp=plus`, the container is working properly. If the output contains `warp=off`, it means that the container failed to connect to the WARP service.

### Configuration

You can configure the container through the following environment variables:

- `WARP_LICENSE_KEY`: The license key of the WARP client, which is optional. If you have subscribed to WARP+ service, you can fill in the key in this environment variable. If you have not subscribed to WARP+ service, you can ignore this environment variable.

- `HEALTHCHECK_RETRY`: Max retry times for healthcheck, default is `3`. It will kill main process and exit container if all failed.
  
Data persistence: Use the host volume `./data` to persist the data of the WARP client. You can change the location of this directory or use other types of volumes. If you modify the `WARP_LICENSE_KEY`, please delete the `./data` directory so that the client can detect and register again.

### Change proxy type

The container uses [GOST](https://github.com/ginuerzh/gost) to provide proxy, where the environment variable `GOST_ARGS` is used to pass parameters to GOST. The default is `-L :1080`, that is, to listen on port 1080 in the container at the same time through HTTP and SOCKS5 protocols. If you want to have UDP support or use advanced features provided by other protocols, you can modify this parameter. For more information, refer to [GOST documentation](https://v2.gost.run/en/).

If you modify the port number, you may also need to modify the port mapping in the `docker-compose.yml`.

### Health check

The health check of the container will verify if the WARP client inside the container is working properly. If not, it will try to correct it.
